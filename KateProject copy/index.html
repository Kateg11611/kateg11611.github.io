		<P style= "color: #20B2AA">This webpage is dedicated to my two sisters. I am the middle daughter between the youngest, Lydia, and the oldest, Elizabeth. My sisters and I grew up together in a small, country town called Carrollton, Georgia. We have always lived close to each other and all of our family. We are all very close and I am glad to have them as allies throughout my life. The picture above was taken before a UGA football game. This photo was captured during the only year all three of us were students at UGA at the same time. I hope by the end of this webpage you get to know them each a little more. We share so many similarities but also have our unique, individual likes and dislikes. 

 </P>
