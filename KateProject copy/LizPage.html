		<P style= "color: #20B2AA">Elizabeth is twenty-four years old and lives in Atlanta. Elizabeth is a consultant at Deloitte. She is extremely smart. She got a degree in Political Science and International Affairs as well as a masters in public administration. If you’re looking for Elizabeth you can probably catch her in her apartment baking scones or reading a book. One of Elizabeth’s best qualities, in my opinion, is her ability to enjoy the simple things in life. She has a deep appreciation for fancy foods, new knowledge, and the simple pleasure of having a relaxing day off of work. I have always looked up to Elizabeth as a model of success and kindness to others. She is such a joy to be around and can make anyone laugh.
