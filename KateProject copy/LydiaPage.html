		<P style= "color: #20B2AA">Lydia is the youngest at twenty years old. Lydia is a very active, unique person that always keeps you on your toes. She is employed at multiple places with multiple jobs such as a personal trainer, a farmer, photographer, and social media manager. Lydia loves agriculture and has a strong passion for sustainability. Lydia is the hard worker that always has a busy schedule. She has been my roommate for twenty years of my life. We are close in age so over the years we have done many activities together and have been mistaken for twins, even though she's at least eight inches taller than me. If you’re looking for Lydia you can probably find her on some random person’s farm or studying in her room that is filled with plants from the floor to the ceiling.
